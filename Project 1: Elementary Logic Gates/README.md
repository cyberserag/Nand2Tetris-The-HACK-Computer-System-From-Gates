### **Project 1: Logic Gates Mastery**

In this project, I didn’t just follow instructions—I built all the required logic gates and went a step further by designing my own optimized gates to simplify complex circuits. Using **HDL (Hardware Description Language)**, I brought to life fundamental components like **AND, OR, NOT, multiplexers**, and more, turning abstract logic into tangible, functioning hardware.
