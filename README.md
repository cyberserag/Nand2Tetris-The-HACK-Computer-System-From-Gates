# Nand2Tetris-The-HACK-Computer-System-From-Gates
Implementing a complete computing platform using HDL, starting from Boolean logic and basic gates through the design of a CPU, memory system, and integrated hardware architecture. The result is a 16-bit general-purpose computer with a software stack supporting compilation and execution of high-level programs on bare hardware.
