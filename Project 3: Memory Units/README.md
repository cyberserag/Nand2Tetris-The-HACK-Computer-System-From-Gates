### **Project 3: Building the Computer’s Memory – RAM from the Ground Up**

With the ALU in place, I shifted focus to the **computer’s memory unit**—the **Random Access Memory (RAM)**. This project took a **bottom-up approach**, starting with elementary **flip-flop gates**, progressing to **1-bit registers**, then **n-bit registers**, and finally assembling a **family of RAM chips**. Step by step, I brought the computer’s storage brain to life, creating a reliable foundation for all future computations.
