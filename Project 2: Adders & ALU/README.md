### **Project 2: Adders & the ALU – The Computer’s Brain**

Building on the chips from Project 1, I designed a **family of adder circuits**—specialized chips that handle numerical addition with precision and efficiency. Taking it further, I integrated these adders into a fully functional **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**—the computational core of a CPU capable of performing a wide range of **arithmetic and logical operations**. Essentially, this project brought the “thinking brain” of a computer to life.
