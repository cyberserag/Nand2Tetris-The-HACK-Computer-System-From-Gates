### **Project 4: HACK Machine Language – Speaking the Computer’s Native Tongue**

In this project, I dove into **low-level programming** by learning and writing programs in **HACK machine language**, the native language of our CPU. I translated abstract ideas into **binary instructions** that the hardware could understand and execute, creating **small but powerful programs** that demonstrated arithmetic operations, memory access, and control flow. This experience gave me a firsthand understanding of how software communicates directly with hardware, bridging the gap between logic gates and full-fledged computation.

>As part of mastering **HACK machine language**, I implemented **Fill.asm** and **Mult.asm**, two illustrative programs that showcased low-level programming concepts:

- **Fill.asm**: Programmatically populated memory with values, demonstrating **memory access, loops, and control flow** at the instruction level. This exercise helped me see how data can be manipulated directly in RAM using basic HACK instructions.
- **Mult.asm**: Implemented multiplication using only **addition, loops, and conditional logic**, highlighting how even complex operations must be built from the CPU’s fundamental capabilities. This program solidified my understanding of **algorithm implementation in a low-level, hardware-oriented environment**.
