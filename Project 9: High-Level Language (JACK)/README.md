### **Project 9: JACK High-Level Language – From Syntax to Full Applications**

In this project, I dove headfirst into **JACK**, the high-level, Java-like language designed for the Nand2Tetris course. The goal was not just to write small programs—but to **build a complete application**, gaining an intimate understanding of the language’s **syntax, grammar, and semantics**.

By working hands-on with JACK, I explored:

- **Expression evaluation** – mastering how computations are expressed and executed.
- **Procedural units** – functions, methods, and constructors, including argument passing and return values.
- **Control flow structures** – `if` statements, `while` loops, and nested logic.
- **Object-oriented concepts** – classes, objects, and encapsulation.

This deep dive was more than practice—it was **strategic preparation for building the compiler** in the following projects. Understanding JACK thoroughly made it possible to write a compiler capable of **parsing high-level text and translating it into intermediate code**, bridging the gap between abstract programming ideas and machine-executable instructions.

In essence, Project 9 transformed me from a JACK learner to a **JACK practitioner**, fully equipped me to develop a nice shooting game that will make you want to play!.. haha.

# Nand2Shooting Game

As part of mastering the JACK programming language, I developed the **Nand2Shooting Game**, an **interactive, visually engaging application** that put my high-level programming skills to the test. This project allowed me to **apply JACK concepts in a real-world context**, combining **procedural programming, object-oriented design, and graphics handling**.

Key highlights of the game development:

- **Interactive gameplay** – Implemented player control, shooting mechanics, and enemy movement, creating a responsive and dynamic experience.
- **Graphics and animation** – Used JACK’s graphic capabilities to render sprites, handle collisions, and manage on-screen updates smoothly.
- **Object-oriented design** – Organized game entities (player, enemies, bullets) as classes with methods, constructors, and state management.
- **Event-driven logic** – Built game loops and control structures that respond to player inputs and game events in real time.

This project was not only **fun and creative**, but also an excellent **hands-on exercise in high-level language design and implementation**. It reinforced my understanding of JACK syntax, object management, and control flow, while demonstrating how abstract programming concepts translate into **fully functional, interactive software**.

The shapes and graphics build in this game were constructed using a simple bitmap object. Each object is 16x16 bits in memory which is just 16 words. Tweaking these words with the proper value will result in creating the desired graphics.
