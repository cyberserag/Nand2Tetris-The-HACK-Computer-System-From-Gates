Building on the VM from Project 7, this project focused on **program control and subroutine management**—essential features for a complete compiler backend. I extended the VM to support:

- **Program flow commands**: Conditional branching, loops, and control structures.
- **Function calls and stack frames**: Implementing subroutine calling, argument passing, and local variable management.

This stage emphasized **how high-level constructs like `if` statements, `while` loops, and functions** are translated into low-level stack-based operations. By implementing these features, I created a **robust VM translator** capable of turning VM code into Hack assembly programs that can be executed directly on the Hack computer.

Key insights from this project:

- **Virtualization principles**: How one system can emulate another to achieve **cross-platform compatibility**.
- **Stack-based function management**: Efficient handling of nested function calls and memory frames.
- **Practical compiler backend experience**: Demonstrated how intermediate code can form the bridge between high-level languages and machine language execution.

Together, Projects 7 and 8 produced a fully functional stack-based virtual machine, providing a clear and hands-on understanding of compiler backends, virtual machines, and the power of abstraction in computing.
